            <p class="Bio">                                     
                    I come from a very large family of fifteen brothers and sisters. Growing up with such a large family made me unbelievably competitive and curious to try new things .
                    I’ve always strived to be the best that I can. i played  multiple sports including rugby and even taught myself how to play the piano. 
                    With such a large curiosity  Ifell into working many different types of jobs. 
                    While working at a restaurant I loved working so much I picked up a second job in construction. 
                    Which in turn lead me to working 60+ hours a week with only one day off a month. I loved it a least for a while.
                    I became fed up with my back always hurting and stress from not sleeping.
                    Then my best friend told me about his career in programming. 
                    I did my research and found out that his is an amazing field where you solve problems and build amazing projects in the process.
                    So i began to studied hard on my own. I learned solo for over a year then found Thinkful.
                    Through Thinkful I’ve learned how to become a full stack developer.
