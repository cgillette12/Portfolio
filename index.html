                So I guess you would like to get to know me. Well let’s start with my background. I come from a very large family of fifteen brothers and sisters.
                Growing up with such a large family made me unbelievably competitive and curious to try new things . I’ve always strived to be the best that I can.
                I played  multiple sports including rugby and even taught myself how to play the piano. With such a large curiosity  i fell into working many different
                types of jobs. While working at a restaurant I loved working so much I picked up a second job in construction. Which in turn lead me to working 60+ hours
                a week with only one day off a month. I loved it a least for a while.

                I became fed up with my back always hurting and stress from not sleeping. Then my best friend told me about his career in programming. I did my research 
                and found out that his is an amazing field where you solve problems and build amazing projects in the process. So i began to studied hard on my own. 
                I learned solo for over a year then found Thinkful. Through Thinkful I’ve learned how to become a full stack developer.
